# CV Generation Pipeline

This module contains the offline pipeline used to generate a synthetic dataset of realistic-looking CVs (résumés) in PDF format.

The purpose of this dataset is to support the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow required by the AI-Powered CV Screener application.

This pipeline is intentionally separated from the runtime backend in order to:

- Keep the production API lightweight and free of unnecessary dependencies
- Avoid coupling application startup with external LLM or image generation calls
- Enable reproducible dataset generation for experimentation and evaluation
- Allow regeneration of PDFs without re-calling the LLM
